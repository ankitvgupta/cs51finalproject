                Zhou Yongkang, a member of Chinaœôòùs ruling Politburo Standing Committee from 2007 to 2012, is the subject of one of the highest-level corruption investigations in the history of the Peopleœôòùs Republic of China. Several members of his family, over the years Mr. Zhou was in power, made investments in companies with ties to the China National Petroleum Corp., the state oil company formerly run by Mr. Zhou, although there is no evidence to show that Mr. Zhou was personally involved in the dealings.            </p>

He has widened the inquiry into Mr. Zhou to include his wife, a son, a brother, a sister-in-law, a daughter-in-law and the sonœôòùs father-in-law, all of whom have been taken away by the authorities in recent months, according to relatives and witnesses.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="437" data-total-count="2098" itemprop="articleBody" >Zhan Minli, one of the few members of the clan who remain free, said her granddaughter œôòô who is also Mr. Zhouœôòùs granddaughter œôòô has been left in the care of a kindergarten in Beijing because the rest of the family is in custody. œôòüIt is too cruel for a 5-year-old child,œôòý she said in an interview in her home in Southern California. œôòüThe government needs to answer to the people as well as the leadership itself,œôòý she added.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="241" data-total-count="2339" itemprop="articleBody" >Officially, the Chinese leadership has said nothing about the corruption investigation into Mr. Zhou or the detention of his immediate relatives, and Mr. Xiœôòùs ultimate intentions about how to handle the case remain a matter of speculation.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="382" data-total-count="2721" itemprop="articleBody" >Some political analysts argue that a leader of Mr. Zhouœôòùs status would not face an inquiry of this kind unless Mr. Xi regarded him as a direct threat to his power. In other words, Mr. Zhou is the loser in a political struggle. His familyœôòùs financial dealings lost their immunity only because Mr. Zhou fell from favor, not because elite business dealings were being criminalized.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="552" data-total-count="3273" itemprop="articleBody" >But another school of thought is that Mr. Xi considers the enormous agglomeration of wealth by spouses, children and siblings of top-ranking officials a threat to Chinaœôòùs stability by encouraging mercenary corruption and harming the partyœôòùs public standing. Those people say he has pushed the Zhou investigation beyond traditional bounds to signal that the rules have changed and that top leaders will be held responsible for their familyœôòùs business activities, even though Mr. Xiœôòùs own family members have been among those who have grown rich.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="318" data-total-count="3591" itemprop="articleBody" >If that is so, the case has the potential to alter the political compact of Chinaœôòùs boom years.

Within three weeks of Mr. Xiœôòùs elevation, and Mr. Zhouœôòùs retirement, party investigators detained a senior official in Sichuan Province who had risen under Mr. Zhouœôòùs wing. Since then, the authorities have detained and announced investigations into more than two dozen of Mr. Zhouœôòùs former aides and colleagues, and their business allies, including seven men who worked as senior managers at China National Petroleum Corporation or its listed arm, PetroChina.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="328" data-total-count="6530" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-2" >No evidence has emerged that proves Mr. Zhou, 71, was involved in the investments or did anything illegal.

He kept rising through the ranks until he became head of C.N.P.C., the nationœôòùs largest energy company, which accounts for more than half of Chinaœôòùs oil production and three quarters of its gas production.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="7381" itemprop="articleBody" >Mr. Zhou later became party chief of Sichuan, one of the countryœôòùs most populous provinces.
